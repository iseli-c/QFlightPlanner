The "Flight Planner" plugin was originally developed by https://github.com/JMG30 as part of a thesis project at AGH University of Science and Technology. In 2025, in agreement with the original author, a team from Warsaw University of Technology decided to perform a major code refactor and took over the maintenance and further development.

# Flight Planner - refactored version

QGIS plugin for planning photogrammetric flights.

Plugin consists of two parts:
1. Flight Design panel, where user needs to provide:
   - camera parameters (focal length, sensor pixel size, pixel image width and height),
   - desirable GSD or Altitude Above Ground Level,
   - maximum and minimum terrain heights in the Area of Interest (only for 'One Altitude ASL For Entire Flight' mode),
   - two margins of exceeding photos outside the AoI.
   
   If user loaded Digital Terrain Model DTM, the plugin allows to choose from two additional
methods of flight altitude (except the basic method 'One Altitude ASL For The Entire Flight'):
   - Separate Altitude ASL For Each Strip,
   - Terrain Following.
   
   For corridor type flight user needs *.shp layer showing axes of flight
and sets buffer size. For block type flight user needs *.shp layer presenting Area of Interest
and sets flight direction. The results are 4 layers: projection centers of photos
(with attribute table containing External Orientation parameters), photos (size at mean terrain height),
waypoints and flight line.

   Terrain minimum and maximum heights are computed automatically from the selected DTM
whenever the area of interest, corridor line, buffer or tab changes; there is no separate
"Update Heights from DTM" action. In 'One Altitude ASL For Entire Flight' mode the flight
altitude is referenced to the lowest terrain elevation, so the requested GSD is achieved
there and bettered everywhere else. With the adaptive overlap option enabled, line and
photo spacing follow the local terrain so the specified front/side overlap is maintained
at every elevation; if the relief is too large to keep the overlap, the design is aborted
with an explanatory message. The live preview can optionally apply the same adaptive
layout via the "Adaptive spacing in preview" checkbox.


2. Quality control panel for assessment of the flight (project or already done) in the form of output:
   - vector layer of real photos coverage (footprint),
   - raster layer of the nubmer of overlapping images,
   - raster layer of ground sampling distance (GSD).
To conduct assessment user needs to provide projection centers layer
(with External Orientation parameters), camera parameters and DTM.
